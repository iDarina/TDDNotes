## Software Development Costs:
* Maintenance costs make up a significant part of total development expenses.
* Challenges contributing to higher costs include:
* Code degradation over time.
* Silos in code ownership leading to fragmentation and lack of cohesion.
* Infrequent validation and testing, causing issues to persist.

## Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD):
* TDD is a development approach where tests are written before the actual code.
* This method encourages continuous testing, helping to address maintenance and cohesion issues.

## The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:
* Red: Write a test that fails (as the feature hasn't been implemented yet).
* Green: Write the minimum code needed to pass the test.
* Refactor: Improve code quality without altering functionality.
* This cycle is a core part of TDD, guiding developers through structured coding and testing.

## Benefits of Practicing TDD:
* Catching Regressions: TDD helps identify bugs introduced by new changes, making regression detection more reliable.
* Reduced Maintenance Costs: Regular testing makes code easier to maintain and reduces the need for extensive fixes later.
* Increased Developer Productivity: Developers work more efficiently, confidently navigating and improving existing code.
* Alignment with Customer Needs: TDD keeps developers focused on delivering features that meet customer requirements and adds value.

## Types of Testing:
* Unit Testing: Focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
* Integration Testing: Verifies that different modules or services work together correctly.
* Acceptance Testing: Ensures the application meets business requirements and provides value to the end user.

## Balanced Testing Approach:
* Emphasized the importance of balancing between unit, integration, and acceptance tests to achieve comprehensive test coverage without overloading any single type of test.

## Testing Concepts:
* Black-box Testing: Tests functionality without knowing the internal workings of the code (based on expected outputs for given inputs).
* White-box Testing: Tests the internal structure and logic of the code, ensuring that each path and branch works correctly.
* Test Suite: A collection of tests grouped together to validate a specific aspect or module of the application.
* Test: A single, specific check to verify a particular functionality or behavior.

## Test Runner:
* Introduced the concept of a test runner, a tool that executes tests automatically.
* Tests can be executed all at once (parallel) or in a sequence (serially), depending on the requirements.

## Testing Strategies and Techniques:
* Explored various strategies to effectively test code, focusing on improving testability and reliability.

## Dependency Injection:
* Defined dependency injection as a technique for providing external dependencies to a class or function, rather than creating them within.
* Highlighted how dependency injection simplifies testing by allowing us to easily swap in mock objects or stubs in place of real dependencies.

## Test Doubles:
* Introduced test doubles (e.g., mocks, stubs, fakes, spies) as stand-ins for real objects during tests.
* Showed how test doubles allow for better control over testing environments, enabling us to isolate code behavior and simulate specific conditions.

## Best Practices for Writing Tests:
* Treat Test Code Like Production Code: Write clean, maintainable test code thatâ€™s easy to read and update.
* Avoid Overly Assertive Tests: Focus on meaningful assertions that test core functionality rather than every minor detail, to reduce fragility.
* Leave Code Better Than You Found It: Use refactoring to improve code quality as part of testing, ensuring that code remains clean and maintainable.
